# Delete Packages GitHub Action

GitHub action to determine and delete existing versions of GitHub packages.

:rocket: This action uses [Ma-Vin/packages-action-app](https://github.com/Ma-Vin/packages-action-app) to process the main logic. The ***golang*** binary will be downloaded from [release v1.1](https://github.com/Ma-Vin/packages-action-app/releases/tag/v1.1)

üê§ This repository and [Ma-Vin/packages-action-app](https://github.com/Ma-Vin/packages-action-app) are just a try out of GitHub Action, GoLang and GitHub rest api.
